THE PASSWORD MANAGER PROJECT:
STEP 1: Install the required libraries and Import the necessary modules.
STEP 2: Generate and Store Encryption Key- The encryption key needs to be generated once and stored securely.
STEP 3: Implement Password Storage and Retrieval- (ADD, SAVE, LOAD, STRENGTH CHECK, DELETE, SPECIFICIATION VIEW AND DELETE)
STEP 4: Create the Command-Line Interface- The CLI will allow the user to interact with the password vault using simple commands.
STEP 5: Run the CLI Application- Now, we can run the script, and the CLI will allow you to add, view, show, and delete passwords securely.
